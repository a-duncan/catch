# catch
You are a flying saucer that grabs and throws objects.


## Controls
**Movement: Mouselook + WASD**

**Grab: Right Mouse Button** - Click and hold to activate a spherical tractor beam that holds nearby objects in their position relative to the player.

**Throw: Left Mouse Button** - Click while already grabbing to launch any grabbed objects away from the player.

**Jump: Space** - This also continues to vertically boost the player while held midair.

**Sprint: Left Shift** - Hold while moving for faster movement.

**Dive: Left Ctrl** - Hold in midair to boost downward.

**Pause Menu: ESC** - Resume, reload, options, or quit. The options submenu has settings for mouse sensitivity and y-axis inversion.

There are two sets of alternate bindings:
- Numpad key bindings for left-handed mouse users. Up, down, left, right are 8, 2, 4, 6, and jump, sprint, dive are 0, +, enter respectively. Mouse settings are not changed.
- Game controller bindings for a generic "gamepad". These may or may not work depending on your controller.


## Levels
As of v0.0.2, there are two levels (and a main menu).

1. Sandbox: an environment with no defined game objectives, but many grabbable objects -- balls, rocks (grey cubes), and ice (blue cubes). Try some of the following:
- Throw a ball at a rock pile! 
- Grab a rock pile and carry it around the map! Throw it at the ice wall! 
- Grab a big chunk of ice and launch the cubes in all directions!
- Toss a ball straight up, then catch it before it hits the ground!

2. Lava Hailstorm: try to take the ball up to the top of the tallest pillar! Hail might get you down but you can always get the ball and try again. The ball is fire-proof, but you are not! Don't get too close to the lava!


## Things to come!
In v0.0.3 I hope to add
- Sound effects
- More levels with actual objectives
- Improved catching/throwing mechanics
- Other stuff I'll think of later

In v0.1 there will be real life cold fusion and faster-than-light travel. Or maybe just multiplayer, we'll have to wait and see.
